                  I’m a software engineering student focused on backend development with a growing interest in UI/UX
                  design. I enjoy building clear, well-structured applications and understanding how systems work behind
                  the scenes. I value clean code, logical thinking, and practical solutions, and I’m constantly
                  improving my skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning.
